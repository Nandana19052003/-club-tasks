Here we use the pytesseract library to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on an image file and then use the eval() function to evaluate the resulting text as a Python expression. If the image file contains text that represents a valid Python expression and the pytesseract OCR successfully extracts that text, the code will print the result of evaluating the expression.

This specific implementation using eval() function is not recommended due to security reasons as user input to eval() function can be used to execute arbitrary code and also might lead to system compromise.
