Firstly define a variable url that contains the URL of the webpage you want to access, which is a website that provides real-time information about the coronavirus pandemic.
Send a GET request to the specified URL.
The allow_redirects parameter is set to True, which means that the function will automatically follow any redirects that are returned by the server. This can be useful if the server redirects the client to a different URL, but it can also introduce security risks if the server redirects the client to an unexpected location.

The response variable will contain the server's response to the GET request. The status_code attribute of the response object can be used to check if the request was successful. A status code of 200 indicates that the request was successful and the server returned the requested content, while other status codes indicate different types of error or redirection.
We should also check if the content is available before proceeding with webscrapping.

Add a delay between requests to a website, also known as "rate limiting", to avoid overloading the server or getting blocked by the website. This can be achieved by using time.sleep() function to pause the script for a specific amount of time between requests.

Some websites may disallow scrapping and will block or return a 403 or 401 error. It is always a good idea to check the website's policy about scrapping before doing so.

We're using the BeautifulSoup library to parse an HTML response that we've received from some kind of request (presumably an HTTP request). The response.text attribute is a string containing the full HTML response that you've received.

We're taking only the first 1000 characters of response.text using string slicing (response.text[:1000]), and passing that to the BeautifulSoup constructor to create a new BeautifulSoup object, which we're storing in the variable soup_sample.

It's often useful to work with a smaller subset of the data while developing and testing your code, so working with soup_sample instead of soup_response can help you test your code more quickly and easily. Once you're confident that your code is working as expected, you can test it on the full soup_response object.

Check if this is a valid html by calling soup_sample.prettify() to see the nested structure of the html.

find_all() method of the BeautifulSoup object, soup_response, to find all the div elements in the HTML document that have an id attribute with the value "maincounter-wrap". The find_all() method will return a list of all matching elements, and you're storing that list in the variable sections.

We are assuming that the variable sections contains a list of three elements, the first one representing the number of cases, the second one representing the number of deaths, and the third one representing the number of recoveries.

Then we're using the find() method to search for the first span element that is a child of the current element, in this case the div element, this is done for the first, second and third element respectively.

We are then using the text attribute to get the text content of the span element, which should be the number of cases, deaths or recoveries.

create a new directory (folder) in the current working directory (the folder where the Python script is located) called "Documents".

Iterating through each element in the rows list (which should contain all the rows of a table), and for each row, you're using the find_all() method to find all the td elements within the current row. This will give you a list of all the cells (columns) in that row.
use the del statement to remove the 8th column from the country_info list, which doesn't contain any useful information for us.Finally, you're appending country_info to the global_info list.

After the loop, you are printing the first 10 rows of global_info using slicing and the number of rows (countries) using the len() function.

Then you use the del statement again to delete the first row of the global_info list which contains statistics of the whole world rather than a specific country.

The code you've provided reads in a CSV file using the pandas library's read_csv() function, and assigns the resulting DataFrame to the variable data. It then selects the first 10 rows of the DataFrame and assigns them to the variable item.

After that, it creates a new file name by concatenating a string "./Documents/covid-19-10-country-statistics" with the variable date (which should be defined earlier in your code) and the file extension ".csv". The to_csv() method is then used to write the contents of the item DataFrame to the specified file, with the indexing option set to false, meaning the resulting csv will not contain the index.

The resulting file will be saved in the directory "./Documents" with the name "covid-19-10-country-statistics" + value of date variable + ".csv"
